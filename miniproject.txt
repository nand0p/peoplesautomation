Automation for the People
Mini-Project

1. Write code in a programming language (or languages, configuration management

platforms, etc.) of your choice that provisions an environment running on the Linux or

Windows operating system (You can choose any supported version of Linux or

Windows). The infrastructure code only needs to provision the environment resources

and configure a web server. The home page should display a static HTML page with

the words: “Automation for the People” . There should be a single command that

launches this environment.

2. Commit all code to a public version­control repository of your choice (e.g. Github) and

provide usage instructions.

EXTRA: Write automated infrastructure tests to verify the environment works as expected

NOTE: If you choose to deploy your environment onto AWS, we will provide you a $20

Amazon gift card to reimburse you for your AWS costs.
